Use Assassin's Mark to choose a target, and then make the most of the Assassin’s high speed and Leap to close the distance. Assassin's Mark gives Resistance to the marked character's damage, but can't be swapped until the marked character is destroyed, so consider this when selecting targets. Without optional systems like the “Devil's Cough\" Shotgun, Assassins only have access to melee attacks and are fairly vulnerable to sustained damage."
