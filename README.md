# Kai's NPC Rebake LCP
An unpacked LCP containing the playtest versions of Kai's NPC rebakes. For more info, please search the Pilot.net Discord for his pdfs.

Each folder is intended to be rezipped and renamed to an LCP individually. Step by step, that would be:
- Select contents of either the "Grunt Rebake" folder or the "NPC Rebake" folder. *Do not select the folder itself*.
- Right click and select "Add to "folder-name.zip"
- Change the file extension to .lcp
  - Similar instructions will work for other non-Winrar compression programs
### Convention & Format
All ids are being named as "npc-rebake_(DEFAULT_ID_HERE)". See existing rebakes for example.

### Templates
Kai's Grunt rebake will be included due to it functioning more like a class. The Veteran rebake will not as it's designed to function with base NPCs and is therefore incompatible with the NPC rebakes.
